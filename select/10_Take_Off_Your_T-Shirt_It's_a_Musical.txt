Let's Kill Saturday Night
It's A Secret
It's a Secret (Paul Foglino)

Met a girl last night
She asked if I would stay
I said "All right"
She just turned and walked away
She didn't say why
Must have thought I knew
I guess she just had better things to do

When I first met you
I was nervous in my haste
You're such a lady
A girl of wealth and taste
And when I kissed you
I thought I had it made
Saw pearly gates and touched a razor blade

Someone's got to tell me about these morbid fascinations
Someone's making love and I'm just making conversation
Sometimes I think I've got it but it always comes and goes
It's just a secret that everybody seems to know

When we're together
We're drinking to your health
And when we're talking
You're talking about yourself
I think about you
Call you on the phone
But when I'm with you I just feel more alone

Someone's got to tell me about these sexual relations
Someone's making love and I'm just making conversation
Sometimes I think I've got it but it always comes and goes
It's just a secret that everybody seems to know

You say you like me
But not like other guys
You tell your friends
You say I'm very nice
It's just a game
And you just want to play
When you break me you can just throw me away

Someone's got to tell me about these morbid fascinations
Someone's making love and I'm just making conversation
Sometimes I think I've got it but it always comes and goes
It's just a secret that everybody seems to know
