What a love this is
You got love on a lovethesis
Did i say you could look at me
Quit looking at me

You know the drill
You know how it goes
I wanna see you strip now
So take off your clothes (X4)

I bought love just a minute
I bought a hand
Sometimes its hard to be a man

You know the drill
You know how it goes
I wanna see you strip now
So take off your clothes (X4)

Take off your clothes.
