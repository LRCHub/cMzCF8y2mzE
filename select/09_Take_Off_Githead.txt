Things are not the way they're meant to be
But if you find the key the rest will follow
In the air or drifting in the sea
But if it's meant to be don't feel the sorrow

When I float in motion silently
The words they say to me are hard to swallow
All the choices that are there for me
There is no door or key the earth is hollow

Sometimes, I see the clues, I hear the words
Maybe sometimes, I see the signs, I know the lines
And if, I come across another twist
Maybe I know, I hear the signs, I see the words
