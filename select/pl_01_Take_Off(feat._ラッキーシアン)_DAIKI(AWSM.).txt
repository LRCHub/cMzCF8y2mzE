Nothing matters
if I fight for my dreams
I'm never
giving up on myself
Every moment
of my life
I'll carry it
on to my highway
I'm not scared of
being alone
Already got this
Heading in
my own direction
There's no time
for me to look back
Holding on to
keep on rising
to the sky
I'll be
taking actions
No distractions
I just wanna be
who I wanna be
I don't
need exceptions
No delusions
Chance is only once,
you know
When I'm lost
and start to fall,
let me fly up more
Go on,
I've been waiting
for this so long
Fate is
calling me,unlock
another
door And shine
the hope
inside my heart
I don't
need your sympathy
Have it my way
I don't
care what people say
As long as
there's a path to
make Moving forward
till the end
I'm not scared
of being alone
Already got this
Heading in
my own direction
There's no time
for me to look back
Holding on to
keep on rising
to the sky
Breaking
chain reactions
No illusions
I wanna see
what I wanna see
defeat
my obsessions
No hesitations
Breathing dreams
like air in this world
When I start
to feel I'm wrong,
let me prove I'm not
Run on,
I've been seeking
this for so long
It's the
stage for me, unlock
another door
And shine
the hope
inside my heart
I can't deny
Don't ask me why
It's so simple,
just survive
I'll never
cry out
cause the future
awaits me Remember
that to keep in mind
I'll be
taking actions
No distractions
I just wanna be
who I wanna be
I don't
need exceptions
No delusions
Chance is only once,
you know
When I'm lost
and start to fall,
let me fly up more
Go on,
I've been waiting
for this so long
Fate is
calling me, unlock
another
door And shine
the hope
inside my heart
