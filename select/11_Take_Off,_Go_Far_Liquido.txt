I'm so tired today
And that's all I can say
And my mind's about to crack
I've been feeling all right
Only once in a while
Like the leader of the pack
You treat me right
You need me right now
And I don't care at all
So I don't mind
And I feel fine now
I've been here for so long

Chorus:

Take off, go far
You can be sure
You can't turn back
I've lost it all
Take off, go far
You can be sure
You can't turn back
I've lost it all

I'm so tired today
When you call out my name
And you feel the way you do
Wasting all of my time
Burning out of my mind
And I need to feel you still
You tease me right
You please me right now
And I don't mind at all
I'm on my own
I'm all alone now
I was here long ago

Take off, go far
You can be sure
You can't turn back
I've lost it all
Take off, go far
You can be sure
You can't turn back
I've lost it all
I've lost it all

You treat me right
You need me right now
So I don't mind
And I feel fine now

Take off, go far
You can be sure
You can't turn back
I've lost it all
Take off, go far
You can be sure
You can't turn back
I've lost it all
I've lost it all

I was feeling all right
Only once in a while

I've lost it all

I came often this way
You're all in the way
I was feeling all right
Only once in a while
